# Temperature Conversion Application

This application is a simple Java console-based application designed to convert temperatures between Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system to run and compile this program. If you do not have it installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

### How to Run the Application

To run this application, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the Main.java file.
2. Compile the Java file using the command: 
   `javac Main.java`.
3. Run the program using the command: 
   `java Main`.

Upon running the program, you will be prompted to enter a temperature followed by the unit (K for Kelvin, C for Celsius, F for Fahrenheit). The application will then display the equivalent temperatures in the other two units.
